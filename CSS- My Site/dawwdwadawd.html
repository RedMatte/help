          <h3>Udemy</h3>
          <p>
            I took the complete 2020 web development bootcamp from Udemy from
            Angela Yu. This is an intense course has 469 lectures which focuses
            on full stack development. I like this course as it gave me more
            confidence to be able to code than the first one.
